# MNIST Stress Test

MNIST image dataset is 'Hello World!' data for image classification. However, we will do MNIST images classfication with a twist - We will train the models on MNIST dataset but will 
try to test these models on some newly introduced 'noisy' images. These images are intentionally semi-processed compared to actual MNIST images.
